## Running from sources

![build](https://github.com/krosmaker/krosmaker/workflows/build/badge.svg)

### Docker

The default [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) builds the application and serves the generated
static resources with Nginx. It is recommended to run the application via Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
# The application should be available at localhost.
```

### Node.js

The supported Node.js version is stored in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc).
You can run the following commands after cloning the repository:

```bash
# Install dependencies:
$ npm install

# Serve the application at localhost:3000 with hot reload:
$ npm run dev

# Build for deployment and launch a local server:
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# Generate a static project:
$ npm run generate

# Run the formatter on the entire project:
$ npm run format
```

Note that the project uses some outdated library versions with reported
vulnerabilities. This is deliberate, as updating some dependencies breaks
the project or the GUI. Do not attempt to upgrade frozen library versions
without fixing the associated issues.

For a detailed explanation of the project setup, check out
[the Nuxt.js documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
